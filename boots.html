            Some notes on making websites
		Good reason to always close your html tags - find the sewing and embroidery warehouse on wayback machine 
		standard/default landing page should be called index.html
		There are two types of elements - block and inline
		block = takes up a large area of space eg.<div>
		inline = only takes up the space it needs eg.<p>
		when you want to alter a text attribute, its better to wrap the text in an inline element and link it to a css class
		an object can have one id only, but it can have many classes
